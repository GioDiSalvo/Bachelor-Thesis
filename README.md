My Bachelor Thesis. Title "Alcune propriet√† della trasformata di Mellin" (Italian). I introduce some basic tools in Analytic Number Theory, to eventually approach to statement and proof of Perron's formula and Riemann's Explicit Formula (an important link between non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta and prime numbers)
